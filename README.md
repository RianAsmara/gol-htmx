Here's a draft for the README file for your Go HTMX WebSocket project:

# Go HTMX Real-Time WebSocket Application

This project is a real-time web application built using Go, HTMX, and WebSockets. It implements a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and deploys using Docker and Docker Compose to a Linux VPS.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Powered by WebSockets, providing instant data synchronization.
- **HTMX Integration**: Use of HTMX for interactive HTML components, allowing for seamless UI updates without full page reloads.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Uses Docker and Docker Compose for consistent and efficient deployment on any environment.
- **Linux VPS Deployment**: Easily deployable on a Linux VPS with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- A Linux VPS for deployment

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RianAsmara/gol-htmx.git
cd gol-htmx
```

### 2. Run Locally with Docker

To run the project locally using Docker and Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Run Tests

You can run tests with the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Deployment

### CI/CD Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow automatically:

1. Runs tests on push or pull requests.
2. Builds the Docker images.
3. Deploys the application to your VPS.

### Deploying to a Linux VPS

1. Set up your VPS with Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Configure your VPS to accept GitHub Actions deployments by setting up secrets for SSH and any other environment variables required.
3. Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment.

## Configuration

Configuration settings such as environment variables can be managed within the `.env` file or through Docker Compose settings.
